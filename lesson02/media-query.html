            <p>And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is amerciful unto all who
                believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his
                word.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 27:14</h2>
            <p>And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath aheard the prayers of his people, and also the bprayers
                of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has cprayed with much faith concerning thee that thou
                mightest be brought to the dknowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to econvince
                thee of the power and authority of God, that the fprayers of his servants might be answered according to
                their faith.</p>
