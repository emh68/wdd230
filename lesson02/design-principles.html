            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>Instagram</span>
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>Fitt's Law suggests that the time to reach a target is influenced by the size of the target and its
                    distance from the starting point. Larger targets and closer targets are easier and faster to
                    reach.Instagram's mobile app uses Fitt's Law by having easily accessible icons for actions like
                    posting, liking, and commenting. The design emphasizes simplicity and user-friendly touch targets.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>Apple</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">apple.com</a>
                </p>
                <img src="/lesson02/images/apple.jpg" alt="screenshot of Apple website">
                <p>Hick's Law suggests that increasing the number of choices will also increase the decision time
                    logarithmically. In other words reducing the number of choices can lead to faster decision-making
                    and better user experiences. This type of simplicity and minimalism is demonstrated by Apple's
                    clean, simple look and minimalism. The Apple website keeps things simple and shows you exactly what
                    they have to offer, without a lot of clutter and lots of choices. Everything is minimalistic and
                    simple.

            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>Amazon</span>

                <p>Proximity refers to the placement of elements in close proximity to indicate a relationship. Grouping
                    related elements together helps users perceive them as a single, unified concept. The Amazon website
                    demonstrates this design principle by grouping related elements together on its homepage, such as
                    product categories, to facilitate user navigation and help users quickly find what they are looking
                    for.
